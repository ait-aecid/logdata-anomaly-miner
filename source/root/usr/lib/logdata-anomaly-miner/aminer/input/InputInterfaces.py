        @param end_of_stream_flag this flag is used to indicate, that the streamData offered is the last from the input stream.
        If the streamData does not form a complete atom, no rollover is expected or rollover would have honoured the atom boundaries,
        then the StreamAtomizer should treat that as an error. With rollover, consuming of the stream end data will signal the
        invoker to continue with data from next stream. When end of stream was reached but invoker has no streamData to send,
        it will invoke this method with zero-length data, which has to be consumed with a zero-length reply.

        consumed at the moment but data might be consumed later on. The only situation where 0 is not an allowed return value
