# named here do not need to exist when aminer is started. This
# will just result in a warning. However if they exist, they have
# to be readable by the aminer process! Supported types are:
# * file://[path]: Read data from file, reopen it after rollover
# * unix://[path]: Open the path as UNIX local socket for reading
# DEMO: FORBIDDEN RELATIVE PATH!

# control connections. When missing, no remote control socket
# will be created.

# Read the analyis from this file. That part of configuration

# Read and store information to be used between multiple invocations
# of AMiner in this directory. The directory must only be accessible
# to the 'AMinerUser' but not group/world readable. On violation,
# AMiner will refuse to start. When undefined, '/var/lib/aminer'
# is used.

# Define how many seconds to wait after a first event triggered

# to avoid spamming. All events during this timespan are collected
# and sent out with the next report. Defaults to 600 seconds.
# configProperties['MailAlerting.MinAlertGap'] = 600
# Define the maximum time between two alert e-mails in seconds.
# When undefined this defaults to "MailAlerting.MinAlertGap".
# Otherwise this will activate an exponential backoff to reduce
# messages during permanent error states by increasing the alert
# gap by 50% when more alert-worthy events were recorded while
# the previous gap time was not yet elapsed.
