logdata-anomaly-miner (0.0.0) xenial; urgency=low

  * Initial Release Features:
    * Common parsing model elements available: fixed strings,
      numbers, IP addresses, date-time fields, delimited fields,
      fixed alphabet fields, ...
    * Common parsing model structural elements: sequences, branches,
      repeated elements, optional elements.
    * Stream and file reading, splitting into lines.
    * Operating system integration: privileged parent process forwarding
      file descriptors to analysis child.
    * Reopening of log files using open/fstat loop.
    * Functionality for state persistence handling between restarts.
    * Analysis components:
      * NewMatchPathDetector: generate events when new match path
